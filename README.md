### Hi there, I'm Aletheia Jung 👋

> **"Data defines itself. Code should only listen."**

I am a **System Architect** with about 30 years of experience in enterprise systems.
I advocate for **Single-Mouth Architecture (SMA)** to eliminate redundancy and optimize for the AI era.

My mission is to restore **Data Sovereignty** and abolish static type dependencies in modern software engineering.

---

### 🔭 Current Focus
- **The SMA Manifesto**: Establishing a new standard for AI-Native Architecture.
- **Implicit Strictness**: Replacing explicit type definitions with semantic naming protocols.
- **JIT Data Bridge**: Creating a seamless flow from DB to UI without boilerplate code.

### 💬 Philosophy
- **One Mouth is Enough**: The database is the Single Source of Truth (SSOT).
- **Zero-Impedance**: Logic should flow like water, unhindered by rigid interfaces.
