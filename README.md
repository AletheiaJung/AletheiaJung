# Hi there, I'm Aletheia Jung 👋

> *"My mind holds countless memories and ideas, yet I speak through a single mouth.*  
> *I don't need a new mouth for each memory, a new voice for each idea."*

This is my philosophy — and the foundation of **Single-Mouth Architecture (SMA)**.

## 🎯 What I Believe

A system contains many data entities — Users, Orders, Products, Transactions.  
But it doesn't need a separate "voice" at every layer.

**One authoritative voice is enough. That voice is the Database.**

Just as my single mouth expresses infinite thoughts,  
a single well-designed database can express all data truths.

The layers above? They don't speak. They **listen and relay**.

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **One Mouth is Enough** | Database is the Single Source of Truth. No redundant definitions. |
| **Implicit Strictness** | Naming conventions replace explicit type declarations |
| **Fluid Integrity** | Runtime defense over compile-time illusion |

## 🌱 Why "Aletheia"?

**Aletheia (ἀλήθεια)** — Greek for "truth" or "disclosure."

In philosophy, it means *unconcealment* — revealing what is hidden.

I chose this name because I believe:
> **Data should reveal its own truth. Code should not conceal it with layers of abstraction.**
